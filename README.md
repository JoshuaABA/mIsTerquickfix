# mIsTerquickfix
Joshua Brock-Anderson, final project-
Mr.QuickFix

My code is a simple input based simulation involving troubleshooting common home network issues.
The new concept I implemented in my code is the try/except function. 
I tested my project by manually restarting the simulation over & over until achieving the results I wanted.
Overall I enjoyed this project. I incorportated feedback from previosu assignments e.g., not letting loops run on infinitely.
Elif statements became much more clear to me while working on this code & how useful they can be.
Time was my biggest challenge, between working fulltime & being a father it took some planning & flexbility to find time to complete this project.
